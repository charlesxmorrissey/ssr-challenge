# AMEX Assessment

Hi there, ðŸ‘‹

Please find my take-home assessment and task notes below. I spent about 2 hours total and was about to get the `cache-fetching-library` to meet the acceptance criteria.

## Getting Started

To see the assessment in action, let's set up the repo.

1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm start` to start our development server
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

# Task overview & notes

## Task 1 - configure and document the repository

Most of the time spent on this assessment was spent on task 2. I ran out of time to configure the project, but here is a list of things I feel it's missing.
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Test (Jest, RTL, or Vitest)

## Task 2 - complete the caching fetch library

I completed the work to make the `cache-fetching-library` work, but it definitely could use some improvements.

*Known issues*
- Error messaging isn't working great right now.
